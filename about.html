<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Hardi Ilaka, I was born in DRCongo in 1997. My parents moved to Uganda in 2003 seeking for refuge in a foreign country after a war broke out for six days 
  consequitive in the city I was born in, hence being raised in foreign country that I call home today. Growing up I  realised that Life had so much opportunities and all you have to do is seize them. I am fluent in 5 languages, French, English,
  Swahili, Lingala and Lunganda.In 2018 we moved to California and I can assure you that, that impacted me a lot in life. But not only that, it also offered lots of opportunities that I had to work on, work hard for, and most of it wasn't handed on a silver plate.
  There's quit alot of things to learn, whereas for me I prefer learning something new everyday.<br></p>
  <p>Back then the internet was still growing and there wasn't as much as to learn compared to today. Technology has grown so fast and it's the Global lead. That's why I endulged myself in it. Study shows that 
  there is over 1billion websites in the whole world today, <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/how-many-websites-are-there/#gref">check it out </a>and over 500,000 plus websites are created on a daily. Then why not join the club of Web Developers if its the global lead, "I told myseld".</p>

  <p>I started My Web Developing journey this year 2024, since then I have fallen in love with coding and being able to create a website form scratch. It's a skill set that I never had. Honestly I thought coding was so difficult
    especially how Hollywood movies exhibit them.But I realised that nothing is impossible as long as you give it enough time and dedication towards that goal, it will come to life. For instance, here is <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com"> a link</a>
   that will take you to one of my favorite anime sites. I am a big Anime fan actually, I don't know about you. <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> has changed my life in an amazing way and I am grateful for the hard work and the time they put in the teaching. </p>
  
  <p>I drove trucks as a CDL driver for years and I worked in different warehouses as well. I gained lots of experiences and skills that taught me lessons, teamwork, patience, customer care, being proactive, communication skills, decision making, and so much more.
    I am a quick learner and I enjoy learning new things, it helps me grow and pushes me to this wanting of exploring new things. "Develop a passion of learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow" Anthony J. D'Angelo.</p>
